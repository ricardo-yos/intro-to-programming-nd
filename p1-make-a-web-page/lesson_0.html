                    <h3>A Brief Definition of HTML</h3>

                        <p>
                            The world wide web is basically a collection of HTML documents. HTML is the language in which these documents are made. HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. Through the HTML we can add images, videos, texts and other sources that compose the internet. These HTML pages are linked together with <em>hyperlinks</em>.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Web Operation</h3>

                        <p>
                            The main idea of the web operation is the communication between the <strong>user&#8217;s computer</strong> and the <strong>servers</strong>.  A person when accessing a page using a web browser initiates communication to a server by requesting a specific resource using a <em>HTTP Protocol</em>. The servers are computers which store and process information that make up the internet. The server responds to the user with the content of the requested resource in a HTML document, the web browser interprets and displays this document on the user&#8217;s screen. For other information, consult <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">Wikipedia page</a>.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Basic HTML</h3>

                        <p>
                            The HTML is composed by the text content which is <q>what you see</q> and the markup which describes how the content looks like. In order to build a HTML page, we need to use <strong>HTML elements</strong>. A HTML page contains several types of HTML elements. Each element has a specific function on a page and it is usually written in a HTML syntax called <strong>tags</strong>. Most elements are written with an opening tag and a closing tag, with the tag content between them. This tag structure is represented as follows:
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align:center;">
                        <code>
                            &lt;<strong>Name</strong>&gt; Contents &lt;<strong>/Name</strong>&gt;
                        </code>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A HTML tag is formed by the name of the element within the angle brackets. The only difference between the opening tag and closing tag is the slash in front of the name for the closing tag.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It is important to note that computers are stupid. It means that they interpret an instruction literally. Even a small mistake given to a computer by the programmer can bring issues and unexpected actions.
                        </p>

                    <h3>HTML Attributes</h3>

                        <p>
                            An HTML attribute can modify some HTML elements giving it an additional functionality or modifying its default function. The attribute is written within the opening tag as shown bellow:
                        </p>

                            <p style="text-align:center;">
                        <code>
                            &lt;<strong>Tag attribute=<q>value</q></strong>&gt; Contents &lt;<strong>/Tag</strong>&gt;
                        </code>
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Tag is the name of the HTML element</li>
                        <li>attribute is the Attribute or the property we want to set</li>
                        <li>value is the value of the property to be set</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>HTML Block and Inline Elements</h3>

                        <p>
                            HTML elements can be either <strong>block</strong> or <strong>inline</strong>. Block elements create an <q>invisible box</q> with height and width around the content. While inline elements are just text without height and width properties.
                        </p>

                    <h3>A Programming Tip</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are too many details to remember when programming HTML. It is not worth to remember all these details. Instead, first we need to think in what we want to do, after, understand the <strong>few big ideas</strong> in how to implement it and finally know where to get the details when we need them. A Google search is a path where we can find really good resources. Another place with good HTML examples is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com/</a>. Following this tip we can do nice things (:
